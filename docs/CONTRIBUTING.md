## Getting Started

The project is developed in collaboration with Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS). RCOS Contributors and HackRPI Organizing Team Contributors please read the section for [RCOS/HackRPI Contributors](#rcoshackrpi-contributors).

If you are not an RCOS contributor we are glad to have your contribution too! Please read the section for [External Contributors](#external-contributors)

If you need help or are interested in getting involved further please join our [HackRPI Organizing Team Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Pzmdt7FYnu)

### RCOS/HackRPI Contributors

You should have Write access to the repository by being a member of the HackRPI organization. If you are not a member of the HackRPI organization then please contact the current Director of Technology to get added.

Because you have write access to the repository you should be able to just clone the repository to make necessary changes.

        git clone https://github.com/hack-rpi/HackRPI-Website-2024.git

### External Contributors

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to our website! To contribute please make a fork of the repository in github and clone your fork

        git clone <link-to-your-fork>

## How to Contribute

Take a look at our open issues on our [issues page](https://github.com/hack-rpi/HackRPI-Website-2024/issues) to find something to do.

### Branches

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We use a modified version of the "GitFlow" method of working with branches. You can learn more about GitFlow [here.](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html)
>
> The only change we make to GitFlow is that we do not have release branches, only the develop and master branch.

For general features please create a branch off of the "develop" branch. Please **do not** branch from main unless it is a quick "hotfix."

### Merging Code

Once you are satisfied with your feature and are ready to merge your changes into the rest of the codebase please follow the following steps.

1. Run `npm run build` to verify that the build passes.
1. Run `npx prettier --write .` to format your code to the same style as the rest of the repository
1. Run `npx eslint .eslintrc.js` to run linting checks to ensure a uniform code style and catch potential bugs.
1. Test your code thoroughly to ensure it looks and works well on mobile and on desktop.
1. Open a pull request into the **develop** branch to get your code reviewed and merged

## Code Style

There are a few code style things to mention:

1. Please use Typescript
   1. For most pages there will be little to no JS functionality required for them and many will be purely HTML and CSS. But still please use TypeScript by using `.tsx` files instead of `.jsx`
1. Please use TailwindCSS
   1. Tailwind can take a little while to get used to, and often it is great to have their [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) pinned / bookmarked. It does become very intuitive after a little while.
   1. If you are annoyed by the long class names Tailwind adds to the HTML then I would recommend the [Inline Fold Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=moalamri.inline-fold).
1. Don't Repeat Yourself
   1. If you find that you are duplicating classes or elements, consider breaking them out into their own component so that they can be reused more easily.
   1. If you find yourself repeating code then try to refactor it out into another function.
1. Stick with the Provided Formatting
   1. ESLint (Linter) and Prettier (Formatter) will help you with sticking with the provided formatting.
   1. You can run eslint with `npx eslint .eslintrc.js`
   1. You can run prettier to format the repository with `npx prettier --write .`
   1. Both of these will run automatically when you make your pull request but its good to stick with the formatting throughout development.

## Bug Reports

If you find a bug but aren't sure how to fix it, let us know by opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/hack-rpi/HackRPI-Website-2024/issues/new)! In your bug reports please include the following things:

1. A description of the bug
1. The expected functionality

1. Screenshots (if you can get some)

## Feature Requests

Ideas flourish when people of all backgrounds contribute. Have a great idea but just not sure how to implement it? Let us know by opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/hack-rpi/HackRPI-Website-2024/issues/new)!

## Pull Requests

In your Pull Requests please make a general description of what you have changed. No need to be to detailed but also don't just leave the description body blank or with "changing stuff."
