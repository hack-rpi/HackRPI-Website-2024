# HackRPI-Website-2024

The HackRPI Website [hackrpi.com](https://hackrpi.com) for our 2024 Hackathon at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

## Tech Stack 💻

A simple, front-end only website with NextJS, React, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository with Git
1.  Create a file named `amplify_outputs.json`, in that file just add `{}`. This file is used for our Schedule page backend, but I don't want to have to give everyone access to AWS. If you need access to modify the schedule page, then please contact the Director of Technology, and they will give you a proper `amplify_outputs.json` file.
1.  Install the dependencies with npm

        npm i

1.  Run the development server with npm

        npm run dev
